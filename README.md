# CS313-Project1
This Project tought me about different types of link lists, and how to traverse and to detect loops in those lists.

## What I Learned:
	- [x] Created a Link List
	- [x] Created Double Link List
	- [x] Created A Polynomial Link List
	- [x] Used Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm to detect loop in Link List
	- [x] Learned to Traverse a Double Link List From The Middle
	- [x] Used the Polynomial Link List to Store Polynomial Equation
